# TrueInfinity

Infinite Layers isn't even infinite! You could only have like 150 prestige layers before it got too laggy. It stores all the info
for every dimension in every prestige layer. In True Infinity it won't be limited like that and you will be able to get somewhere
like {10, 2, 1000} of a resource (BEAF).

Not only that but there will be layers of prestige layers, and layers of layers of prestige layers and layers of layers of 
(... 1000x layers of) layers of prestige layers.

Let's see how far I get before I get bored ;)
